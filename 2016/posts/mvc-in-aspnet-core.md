## A quick write-up on my last demo
This week's Fixxup was all about IoT with Windows and MVC in ASP.NET Core. We had a blast!

In my demo about MVC in ASP.NET Core, there wasn't enough time to properly take you thru building a simple Web API from scratch, only using the bare essentials. Here's a quick write up on what I wanted to demo:

### Requirements
As far as requirements are concerned, you would only need:
- an installation of the latest ASP.NET Runtime (head to http://get.asp.net to get started quickly on your platform of choice)
- your favorite text editor of choice. For this demo I used [Visual Studo Code](https://code.visualstudio.com), but you could literally use anything, even good o'l Notepad.
